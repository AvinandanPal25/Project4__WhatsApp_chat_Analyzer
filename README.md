# **-- WhatsApp Chat Analyzer --**

As the name suggests, this is the platform to ANALYZE your day-to-day conversation with your favourite person or activities on any WhatsApp group that you are part of. 

Almost all of us use WhatsApp on a daily basis. It's a very useful app to stay connected to our favourite persons through chattings, audio and video calling, emojis, stickers, Statuses and what not. As if that person is sitting very next to you. 

And chatting pattern are directly proportional to the persons, their habbits. So, if you have already find this interesting, please continue...

## **Motivation:--**
Mainly I see this application useful for three catagories of persons.
 
- **Academic Groups/ Corporate Groups:** If you are a student or working personnel, you surely are part of several groups. Some with your teachers/ Professors, and some among your collegues. Its quite useful to use this tool to analyze-- 
    - who are more active in the group?
    - when there are more activities in the group?
    - what are the most common words you all use?
    - what your Prof. mostly say? like assignment, submit, meeting, Well done, XD
- **Freinds' Group:** Similar is the case for groups among your friends, but mostly in a fun way. The similar things you can analyze here.
    - the most fascinating though will be to find "most active times" or the "word-cloud"
    - and also whether over time the group has turned cold or not? **_So that one of you can RE-TRIGGER the Bond by sharing a Meme or two._** 
- **Committed peoples:** We all have that friend in our gang, who gets busy talking to their significant other, and avoiding us for a while. They won't play with you, won't talk, won't go for a walk and sip a cup of tea/ coffee, and making Fun together. Sad for us, but good for them. It's fine all in all. 
       
    So this app is useful for those Committed publics :)
    
    It gives insights about you Love life, 
    - helps you find common things between you and your partner,
    - gives you the timelines when you two are together over chat,
    - Emojis you two mostly use,
    - And lastly, it can give you a hint of where things had went wrong, where things went cold, you can revisit that part, may be clear your issues and **_STRENGHTEN the BOND._**

**So, the motive is to help you get insights, and build a better communication** with your close peoples, your family members, friends, love ones, collegues..
#### **AND not to make you SCEPTIC or SUSPICIOUS... so don't be.**
